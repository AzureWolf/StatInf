```{r}
library(datasets)
library(lattice)

xyplot(len ~ dose, ToothGrowth, groups = supp, auto.key = list(columns = 1))
xyplot(len ~ dose | supp, ToothGrowth)
```

The data represents the tooth growth given a specific supplement and a respective dosage.

In order to figure out if the supplements are effective, we will test the hypothesis that one supplement is no better than the other supplement.
If it seems like the data we got is unlikely if there is no difference in effect, we should get, at the very least, a zero within our confidence interval.

```{r}
supp1 <- ToothGrowth$len[1:30]
supp2 <- ToothGrowth$len[31:60]
difference <- supp2 - supp1
mn <- mean(difference)

s <- sd(difference)
mn + c(-1, 1) * qt(0.975, 29) * s/(30)
print(mn)
```

The above means that we can be 95% confident that the average difference is between these values.
In addition, the 95% confidence interval does not overlap with 0, indicating there is a difference in the efficacy in the supplements.
