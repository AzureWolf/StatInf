```{r echo = TRUE}
set.seed(1)

mns = NULL
for (i in 1 : 1000) mns = c(mns, rexp(40,0.2))
```

### 1. Show where the distribution is centered at and compare it to the theoretical center of the distribution.
```{r echo = TRUE}
hist(mns)

print(mean(mns))
print(1/0.2)
```
The distribution is centered at `r mean(mns)`.
The theoretical distribution is `r (1/0.2)`.

### 2. Show how variable it is and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution.

```{r echo = TRUE}
print(sd(mns)^2)
print((1/0.2)^2)
```

The distribution variance is `r sd(mns)^2`.
The theoretical variance is `r (1/0.2)^2`.

### 3. Show that the distribution is approximately normal.

```{r echo = TRUE}
qqnorm(mns^0.2);
qqline(mns^0.2, col = 5)
```

We are able to plot the data on a Normal Q-Q plot.
